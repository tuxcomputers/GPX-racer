Build a user friendly web UI that allows the user to upload two GPX files

The route in the files are then shown on a map in different colours.

A dot is plotted on the route in the same colour as the route

When the user hits go the two dots are moved along the route at a rate that it will take the fastest route 1 minute to reach the end

The user has a slider that allows them to move both dots at the same time.

Each route also has am individual slider that advances that dot

The map page will have an option to put the two dots in the same location as early along the router as possible.

The map will allow the user to start the race from the location of the dot on either route. The user moves the dot on that route and then clicks a button "Start race from here", the other dot is moved to as close as possible to that location

Use the gpx files in the gpx_files as reference.

Have the map zoomed out so that the entire routes are visible

If there is period of time the location is within a 50 meter radius ignore the stopped time

Allow that stopped period of time to be an input on the race page

When the dots are racing do not refresh the map itself just the position of the dots
