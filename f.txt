Build a user friendly web UI to navigate the airports and routes dataset:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatokal/openflights/master/data/airports.dat
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatokal/openflights/master/data/routes.dat

On startup this data is loaded.

I want to be able to view the raw data in a table view, give me a selector to each dataset,
with the ability to search by selecting a field and entering a value.

Provide a pre-selected limit of 200 records, but the ability to change it, or remove the limit entirely.

Provide the ability to sort the dataset by any field.

Provide the ability to download the dataset as a CSV file.

Have a second page that lets you search for all the airports you can reach from a given airport with a single stopover.
